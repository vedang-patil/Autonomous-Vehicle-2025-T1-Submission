/// Question 4: This is an extension task. Look at the interface class Observer. This class's responsibility 
/// is to observe and react any changes happening to the EventEmitter class, which emits an event via calling `emitEvent`. 
/// 
/// Your Task: You are to write a mock implementation using Google Tests of Observer to test that EventEmitter actually calls all its
/// attached Observers. This is called Mock testing, which essentially tests the external APIs of classes, and 
/// their relationship, rather than being concerned with the correctness of the overall application. You are to modify the CMakeLists.txt
/// file at the root of this repository, to make Question-4 utilise Google Tests. You also need to modify this file, to implement the mock, and
/// fix the test to utilise the mock and pass the test. 
/// 
/// More information about integrating Google Tests can be found here https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html
/// You can learn about Mock Testing here: https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html
